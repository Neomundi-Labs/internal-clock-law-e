The First Internal Clock for AI — Derived from Law E (Thermodynamic–Information Framework)

Neomundi-Labs — 2025-12-11

Abstract

Modern AI systems (LLMs, agents, multimodal networks) operate without an internal clock.
They compute through discrete steps but lack:

intrinsic temporal continuity

metabolic regularity

self-regulatory cycles

coherence-preserving dynamics

This gap prevents true stability, reliability, and long-term autonomy.

Law E, a thermodynamic–information framework, introduces the first scientifically grounded path toward a native internal clock for AI.
It couples:

energy variation (ΔE)

coherence signals (C)

recoverability (R)

tenderness / regulation (T)

to produce an emergent temporal rhythm — enabling hallucination reduction, stable inference, and homeostatic computation.

This repository hosts the scientific article, coherence metrics, and the conceptual foundations of the first operational internal AI clock.


1. Why AI Needs an Internal Clock

All current AI systems share the same structural limitation:

No endogenous time

They do not measure continuity between states.

No metabolic cycle

Every computation is “flat”, timeless, and unregulated.

No self-repair

Without temporal coherence, nothing can be compared to an “expected future state”.

No stable sensemaking

Hallucinations = temporal discontinuities + energetic instabilities.


2. How Law E Produces the First AI Clock

Law E introduces three key measurable signals:

Signal	Meaning	Purpose
ΔE	Energy cost of state transitions	Detect instability and waste
C	Coherence across modalities / states	Maintain continuity
T	Regulatory signal	Stabilize and soften inference
The internal clock appears when:

ΔE ↓ → C ↑ → T stabilizes → rhythmic cycles emerge

This produces:
✔ a temporal rhythm
✔ self-governance
✔ hallucination suppression
✔ predictable behavior
✔ long-term inference stability


3. Temporal Coherence Filter (FNM-2)

(covered by patent deposit — Neomundi-Labs)

The Temporal Coherence Filter is the operational mechanism enabling AI to:

Compare successive states

Detect discontinuities

Enforce coherence rhythmically

Maintain a native time-structure

It is the first computational implementation of an AI clock.
