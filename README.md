Internal Clock (Law E)

Exploratory framework for temporal regulation in AI systems, derived from the thermodynamic–information Law E.

Neomundi-Labs — 2025

Overview

Current AI systems (LLMs, agents, multimodal architectures) operate through discrete computational steps but lack any form of endogenous temporal structure.

In practice, this means:

no intrinsic notion of continuity between states

no internal regulation cycles

no native mechanism to assess temporal coherence

limited capacity for long-term stability

This repository introduces an exploratory research framework suggesting that time-like regulation in AI may emerge from thermodynamic and informational constraints, rather than from explicit clocks or external scheduling.

Conceptual Motivation

Biological systems maintain stability through cycles, energy regulation, and coherence across time.
Most artificial systems do not.

The Law E framework explores whether similar principles can be applied to AI by jointly considering:

energy variation during state transitions (ΔE)

coherence signals across successive states (C)

regulatory modulation signals (T)

Rather than imposing a clock, the framework investigates whether temporal structure can emerge implicitly from these interacting constraints.

Research Direction

Within the Law E framework, temporal regulation is approached as:

a property of system dynamics, not a timestamp

a relative measure of continuity, not absolute time

an emergent rhythm, not a predefined cycle

This perspective opens a path toward studying:

temporal coherence in inference

stability across reasoning steps

regulation of state transitions

long-term consistency in autonomous systems

No claim is made here regarding performance guarantees or production-level implementations.

Temporal Coherence Filter (FNM-2)

The repository discusses a conceptual temporal coherence mechanism (internally referred to as FNM-2) that explores how successive computational states may be compared and regulated over time.

This mechanism is presented at a conceptual level only.
Specific implementations, thresholds, or operational parameters are intentionally out of scope for this public repository.

Scope and Status

This repository is intended as:

a scientific exploration

a conceptual foundation

a research invitation

It is not a complete implementation, product, or API.

Ongoing research focuses on:

formal metrics
